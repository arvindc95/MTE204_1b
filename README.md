IMPORTANT: pushing and pulling:
pulling is a way to update your computer with the most recent code.
pushing is a way to send your updates to github, where our code is being hosted.

How to pull:
To pull, just run this command inside the project folder:

    git pull


How to push:
ALWAYS PULL BEFORE PUSHING. Somebody else's updates may tamper with your newest code.
It's difficult on the team if you push code that doesn't work with somebody else's code. Everybody gets affected by this.

    git pull

Verify that everything is fine, then...

    git push
